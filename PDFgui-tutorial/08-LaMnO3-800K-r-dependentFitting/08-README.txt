Data: Neutron data for LaMnO3 at 800K obtained at NPDF at LANSCE

GOAL: Familiarize with setting up an r-dependent fit. Exploration of structural changes at different length-scales from a single dataset assessment.

TASKS:
1) 800K refinement setup, use the same input as for 300K refinement
2) Refine over 20 Angstrom range and observe the results
3) Further, set up an r-dependent fitting with r-min 1.5 Angstroms, and r-max variable, varying it in steps of 1 Angstrom from 4.5 Angstroms to 19.5 Angstroms (15 refinements in total)
4) Explore the results by plotting various refined parameters as a function of refinement index. Note that indices 1, 2, 3, ... correspond to r-max of 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, ....
5) Can you observe an r-dependence of refined parameters?
6) What are the benefits and shortcomings of such refinement protocol?
7) Try the same procedure using finer r-steps of your choice
8) Are all the observed changes in parameters physical? If not, why not? What are the limitatons of this approach?
9) Which quantity can possibly be estimated using this approach, related to nano-scale?
