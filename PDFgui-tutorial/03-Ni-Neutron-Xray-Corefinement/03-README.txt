Nickel refinement information:

Space group:		Fm-3m
lattice a:		3.524 Angstroms
fractional coordinate:	0.0	0.0	0.0
Uiso:			0.005
Qmax:			27 Inv. Angstroms
Qdamp for neutron data:		0.012
Qdamp for X-ray data:		0.045

Data: Ni 300K X-ray data collected at 6-ID at APS using MAR345 image plate detector and neutron TOF data from NPDF at LANSCE

GOAL:		demonstration of corefinement of multiple datasets

TASKS:
1) Set up and execute a corefinement of X-ray and neutron data
2) Review the fit results
3) Think of the reasons why such a corefinement could fail
